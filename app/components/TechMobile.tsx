        At the heart of my website is React, a popular JavaScript library for
        building user interfaces. React allows me to create interactive and
        responsive web applications that provide a smooth and enjoyable browsing
        experience. It&apos;s the foundation of my website&apos;s frontend,
        enabling me to build complex UI components and manage state efficiently.

        I&apos;ve leveraged Next.js, a powerful framework built on top of React,
        to enhance the performance and SEO-friendliness of my website. Next.js
        enables server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simplified
        routing, all of which contribute to faster load times and a better
        overall user experience.

        For styling my website, I&apos;ve chosen Tailwind CSS and daisyUI.
        Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for highly
        customizable designs with a low-level, component-friendly approach. It
        promotes consistency, productivity and maintainability across the
        project. daisyUI is a plugin for Tailwind CSS that provides beautiful UI
        components, making it easier to build a consistent and visually
        appealing interface. Together, they offer a powerful combination for
        creating unique, responsive, and user-friendly designs.

        TypeScript

      <dd>
        I take code quality seriously, and that&apos;s why I&apos;ve implemented
        TypeScript in my development process. TypeScript is a statically typed
        superset of JavaScript, which helps catch errors during development and
        enhances code maintainability and scalability. It ensures that my
        codebase remains clean, readable, and reliable.

        I&apos;ve integrated GitHub Copilot into my development workflow to
        streamline and enhance my code. Copilot provides intelligent code
        suggestions and automation, making coding more efficient and helping me
        deliver high-quality code faster.
