            Hello there! My name is{" "}
            <span className="text-secondary font-semibold">Darick McBride</span>{" "}
            and I am a passionate Senior Software Developer with over{" "}
            {yearsSince()} years of industry experience. When I&apos;m not
            knee-deep in code, you can often find me exploring the beauty of
            nature or spending quality time with my furry friend Pixel.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey as a software developer started with a fascination for
            turning lines of code into functional and user-friendly
            applications. Over the years, I&apos;ve honed my skills and
            developed a profound expertise in React, a technology that has
            revolutionized web development and created endless possibilities for
            building interactive, dynamic, and engaging web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that inspiration often strikes when surrounded by the
            beauty of nature, whether it&apos;s hiking through scenic trails or
            taking a moment to soak in the serenity of a campsite. This
            connection with the natural world fuels my creativity and keeps me
            motivated to craft elegant, efficient, and sustainable software
            solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I&apos;m not in front of my computer screen, you&apos;ll likely
            find me on a hiking trail, capturing breathtaking landscapes with my
            camera, or simply unwinding with my pupper. My passion for dogs has
            led me to appreciate loyalty, dedication, and the importance of a
            strong support system, values that I also bring to my work as a
            developer.
          </p>
